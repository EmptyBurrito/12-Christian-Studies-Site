		<div class="centered-paragraph">
			<p>
				The point in the movie that reinforces the parallels between Jesus and 
				Neo the most is when Neo is shot dead by the "Smiths". After remaining 
				dead for a short time, he seemingly resurrects himself, proving his 
				title of "The One". This is a direct reference to Jesus' resurrection 
				after his crucifixion.

					Now Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, 
					she bent over to look into the tomb and saw two 
					angels in white, seated where Jesusâ€™ body had been, 
					one at the head and the other at the foot. 
					-John 20:11-12
				</p>
			</div>
			<br><br>
			<p>
				Furthermore, the theme of sacrafice and selflesness is present in both 
				Jesus and Neo, with Neo "sacrificing" himself to the Smiths to save humanity, 
				while Jesus sacrifices his life through crucifixion to forgive humanity of 
				their sins.
			</p>

					For God so loved the world that he gave his one and 
					only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish
					but have eternal life.

		<div class="centered-paragraph">
		<p>
			All in all, The Matrix encourages viewers to question their perception of reality,
			to challenge authority, and to embrace the possibility of transcending personal 
			limitations. The message of movie encourages reflection on the nature of truth, the 
			power of belief, and the potential for individuals to play a significant role in 
			shaping their destiny. <br><br>
			This message aligns perfectly with the Bible's themes of faith and transformation 
			through God.
